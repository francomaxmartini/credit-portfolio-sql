# 📌 Key Insights — Credit Portfolio Analysis

## Portfolio Overview
- Active loans represent approximately 75% of total portfolio exposure, while defaulted loans account for the remaining 25%.
- The overall portfolio default rate is around 19%, indicating a non-trivial level of credit risk that warrants monitoring at both portfolio and segment levels.

## Exposure by Region
- The North region holds the highest total exposure (≈ 2.4M) and also exhibits the highest default rate (≈23%), making it the most risk-intensive region in the portfolio.
- The East region has the second-highest exposure (≈ 2.2M) but the lowest default rate (≈14%), suggesting a more favorable risk-return profile compared to other regions.

## Payment Behavior
- Payment behavior varies significantly across loans, with several loans displaying late payment ratios well above the portfolio average.
- The average late payment ratio across the portfolio is approximately 15%, serving as a useful benchmark for identifying underperforming loans.
- A subset of loans shows late ratios exceeding 40–50%, and these loans are flagged as worse than the portfolio average, indicating elevated delinquency risk.

## Business Implications
- The concentration of defaults and high exposure in the **North region** suggests that regional risk drivers should be reviewed, potentially requiring tighter underwriting or closer monitoring in that area.
- The **East region’s combination of high exposure and low default rate** highlights it as a comparatively strong-performing segment that could support controlled portfolio growth.
- Loans with **late payment ratios significantly above the portfolio average** represent clear candidates for enhanced monitoring, early intervention, or remediation strategies.
